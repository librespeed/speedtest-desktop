This is a Compose Desktop based client for LibreSpeed servers, a template similar to the Android app.

It is still WIP, it's not documented yet, but it works and it can be configured by editing the configuration files in `src/main/resources/configs/`.

This application is developed and maintained by Sudo Dios.
