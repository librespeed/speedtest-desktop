# LibreSpeed Desktop App
This is a JavaFX-based client for LibreSpeed servers, a template similar to the Android app.

It is still WIP, it's not documented yet, but it works and it can be configured by editing the configuration files in `LibreSpeed/src/main/resources/configs/`.

This application is developed and maintained by Sudo Dios.

## Run or build
You can run `java -jar ./LibreSpeed.jar` (tested with openjdk 11.0.17)

Or Build with Gradle :
```bash
cd /LibreSpeed
./gradlew run
```
